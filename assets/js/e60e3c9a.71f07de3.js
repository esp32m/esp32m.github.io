Now I need to know which task is responsible for this. We know ESP-IDF dumps some useful info to UART0 when the watchdog is triggered . How nice would it be to send this info over to my logger that passes it on to the rsyslog daemon over UDP! Regretfully, not in this case. If context switches are blocked, WiFi/networking isn't going to function properly, so it is unlikely we're going to succeed with UDP transmission. Additionally, upon reviewing ESP-IDF's panic handler, there isn't a way to redirect or capture an output without modifying the source. So I thought the easiest would be setting up another Raspberry nearby, connect it to ESP32's UART0 and capture the output continuously, which I did.\nResults were puzzling, to say the least.

I started to suspect this may be a hardware issue. I needed a confirmation, so I set up 2 identical ESP32 modules, one on a dev socket, powered by USB, and the other one - "in the field" with all the manual soldering and a bunch of wires. Uploaded identical binaries, connected identical peripheral devices. In a week, my first module had 0 issues, still up and running, and the second one froze once and auto-rebooted 3 times. Definitely a hardware problem. Could it be a faulty ESP32 chip? No problem, replaced it and ran the test again - nothing changed.
