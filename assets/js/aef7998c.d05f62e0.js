Works well for one or two locations, but if you want a dozen - it is an overkill and gets pricey.\nThe next thing I tried was STM32 ("Blue Pill") module wired to ESP8266. STM32 is great to read multiple sensors and control several devices, but doesn\'t have any networking features. ESP8266 is a WiFi chip, but has a very limited number of I/O ports. Together they make a great combo, but there are cons. For example, I had to maintain 2 different firmwares, implement a protocol for the chips to talk to each other, put up with reliability issues because all connections were manually soldered and looked like this:'),(0,r.kt)("p",null,(0,r.kt)("img",{alt:"Manually connected ESP822 and STM32",src:a(2613).Z}),"\nAnother thing is the amount of available RAM/flash, that is pretty restrictive on both chips."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Finally, I found this beautiful ESP32 module that had everything I could ever think of, and more - in a single tiny module, for a very competitive price (N.B.: no, I'm not paid to advertise ESP32, nor am I affiliated with Espressif in any way.

The last missing piece of the puzzle was the software. At first, Arduino seemed like a very natural choice.

It uses pre-configured (and, possibly, patched) version of ESP-IDF, and if you want to re-configire it for your particular needs (which is a common practice for ESP-IDF application), you're in for another challenge.

No, it is perfectly possible to do multitasking in Arduno, there are scheduling libraries that offer pseudo-multitasking, and if there's native MCU support (which is the case for double-core ESP32) - you can always call native functions directly. At the same time, most of the Arduino libraies don't expect to be run in a multitasking environment, they don't care about synchronization, locking and race conditions, so one has to either patch the source, or apply various hacks to achieve stable performance. One example would be the ",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"//github.com/PaulStoffregen/OneWire"},"OneWire library"),". This is a well-designed and mature library that works perfectly on AVR, STM32 (and I would expect, on other single-core MCUs in a single-thread mode). OneWire protocol depends on proper timing, so the library disables interrupts when sending/receiving data packets, with the naive belief that interrupts are the only possible cause of inaccurate time measurements and prolonged delays. Wrong! ESP32 context switches must be disabled as well, or the code must be re-designed to allow for a context switch to occur safely at the very moment when the protocol expects to see state change on the 1WIRE bus. As a result, this library fails consistently on ESP32 with multiple running tasks. For me, only about 30% of the measurements were successful and the rest were failing.
